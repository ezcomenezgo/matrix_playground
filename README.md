This is a matrix with the following actions:

- When you click a cell, all values in the cells in the same row and column will increase by 1, and their background will briefly turn yellow.
- If there are any 5 consecutive numbers forming a Fibonacci sequence, these cells will be cleared and their background will briefly turn green.
